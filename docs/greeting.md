# üì¢ Welcome to the Authentication Module Docs!

Welcome to the **Authentication Module**, a plug-and-play authentication solution designed for seamless integration into any Node.js-based application. This module provides a secure and scalable authentication system with JWT-based authentication, refresh tokens, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

Whether you are building a new project from scratch or adding authentication to an existing app, this module allows you to **quickly implement** user authentication with minimal configuration.

---

## üîç What is this Module?  

The **Authentication Module** is a fully functional authentication system designed to be **cloned, configured, and deployed** inside any project. Unlike a central authentication API, this module is meant to be included **inside your own application** as a GitHub submodule or a standalone service. It supports both **PostgreSQL and MongoDB**, making it highly flexible for different use cases.

## üèóÔ∏è How it Works  

This module follows a **JWT-based authentication flow** with refresh tokens and optional multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Login Flow  
- The user enters their **email** and **password**.  
- The backend **verifies** the credentials.  
- If **MFA is disabled**, the server generates **access** and **refresh tokens**, sending them via **`httpOnly` cookies**.  
- If **MFA is enabled**, a **Temporary Session Token** (generated via Node.js `crypto`) is sent to the frontend for MFA verification.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MFA Verification Flow (if enabled)  
- The user enters their **MFA code**.  
- The backend verifies the **Temporary Session Token**.  
- If valid, it retrieves the user and verifies the **MFA code**.  
- If successful, **access** and **refresh tokens** are issued and sent via **`httpOnly` cookies**.  
- **Temporary Session Tokens** expire automatically and are deleted after use.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Token Lifecycle  
- **Access Token** ‚Üí **15 minutes**  
- **Refresh Token** ‚Üí **7 days** (rotation planned for future updates)  
- **Password Reset Token** ‚Üí **1 hour**  
- **Temporary Session Token (MFA)** ‚Üí **15 minutes**  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Password Reset Flow  
- The user requests a **password reset**.  
- A **password reset token** (generated via Node.js `crypto`) is sent via email as a **URL** to the frontend.  
- The frontend submits the **token** and **new password** to the backend.  
- If the token is valid, the **password is updated**.
